    "1. Introduction to File Handling\n",
    "File handling is an important part of programming, as it allows you to interact with files on your system. In Python, there are built-in functions that make file handling simple and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic File Operations:\n",
    "-   Reading a file: Retrieve and display the contents of a file.\n",
    "-   Writing to a file: Save or append data to a file.\n",
    "-   Python provides various functions and methods to perform these operations in a clean and structured way."

    "    'w': Write (creates a new file or overwrites existing content).\n",
