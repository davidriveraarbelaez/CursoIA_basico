        "6. When to use Lists?\n",
        "\n",
        "You should use lists in Python when:\n",
        "   1. **You need to modify the collection:** Lists are mutable, meaning you can change, add, or remove elements after the list is created. If your data needs to be updated frequently, lists are the better option.\n",
        "**Example:** Managing a dynamic list of tasks or items in a shopping cart.\n",
        "   2. **Order of elements matters:** Lists maintain the order in which elements are added. If you care about the order of items (e.g., maintaining a sequence of actions or events), lists are a good choice.\n",
        "**Example:** Keeping track of steps in a process or storing data where order is critical (e.g., timestamps).\n",
        "   3. **You need to store a collection of similar items:**Lists are commonly used to store collections of homogeneous items (like a list of numbers, strings, or objects) but can also handle mixed types if needed.\n",
        "**Example:** Storing a list of students' names, a sequence of numbers, or objects in a game.\n",
        "   4. **You need to perform frequent updates or operations on the collection:**\n",
        "Lists support many operations that make data manipulation easy (such as appending, popping, sorting, reversing, etc.).\n",
        "**Example:** Maintaining a to-do list where you regularly add and remove tasks.\n",
        "   5. **Memory efficiency isn't a concern:** Lists take more memory than tuples since they are mutable. If memory efficiency is not critical, and you value flexibility, lists work well.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use Cases:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Dynamic collections:** Shopping lists, task lists, chat messages in real-time, sensor data that updates periodically.\n",
        "*   **Frequent modifications:** Storing a list of items where elements will frequently be changed, like managing the state of an application or user input.\n",
        "*   **Iterative processes:** Use lists for looping through elements, especially when the collection needs to be modified during iterations."
